HackerNews chrome extension
===========================
I am an active reader of HackerNews, and I made this extension for personal use only. But today I decided to upload the extension on chrome store and published it.

It has lot of things to improve. I am backend developer and not good in designing and frontend development. But I felt the need so I just learned it and created.

If you are interested to make it better, you are welcome.
